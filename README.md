# üè† House Price Prediction: Empowering Real Estate Decisions

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices using historical data and property features. The project aims to:
- Achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below $50,000.
- Provide actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.
- Highlight key factors influencing house prices.

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle: [House Sales in King County Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). The dataset provides detailed information on home sales in King County, Washington, including property features, sale prices, and geographical data.
