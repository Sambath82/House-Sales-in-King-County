# 🏠 House Price Prediction: Empowering Real Estate Decisions

## 📋 Objective
This project aims to predict house prices with high accuracy, achieving a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below $20,000**, using historical data and key property features. The goal is to provide **buyers**, **sellers**, and **real estate professionals** with actionable insights for making informed decisions in a competitive market.
